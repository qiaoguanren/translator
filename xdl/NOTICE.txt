Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs and VARs

The Cronin Group provides its XDL software Library under a dual license model
designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial
distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.

For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications:

OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors),
VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and
distribute commercially licensed software with XDL software must enter
into a commercial license agreement with the Cronin Group.

For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications:

For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under
the AGPL v3 that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with
XDL software, Cronin Group's XDL open source software licensed under
the AGPL v3 is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license
other than the AGPL v3, the Cronin Group makes its AGPL v3-licensed XDL
Libraries available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the those
XDL Libraries under certain conditions without causing the entire
derivative work to be subject to the AGPL v3.
