================
Making New Steps
================

All steps should inherit :code:`xdl.steps.AbstractStep`.

Attributes to implement:

- :code:`PROP_TYPES`: The types of all :code:`__init__` arguments except :code:`self` and
  :code:`**kwargs`.
- :code:`DEFAULT_PROPS`: Default values for any keyword arguments with the
  default set as :code:`'default'`.
- :code:`INTERNAL_PROPS`: Internal properties that are programmatically extracted from the graph
  in :code:`on_prepare_for_execution`. These properties are never written when
  outputting XDL files.
- :code:`PROP_LIMITS`: Limits on what values are acceptable for given properties.
  If no prop limit is supplied for a prop, then a default limit is used based
  on the prop type.
- :code:`ALWAYS_WRITE`: Usually properties are not written to file if there
  value is the same as the value defined in :code:`DEFAULT_PROPS`. If the
  property is included here, it will always be written even if it is the
  default.

Methods to implement:

- :code:`__init__`: Take properties as arguments and call :code:`super().__init__(locals())`
- :code:`get_steps`: Return a list of steps to be executed when the step is executed.
- :code:`on_prepare_for_execution`: Make any graph specific changes to the steps
  required.
- :code:`sanity_checks`: This returns a list of :code:`xdl.utils.misc.SanityCheck`
  objects which are checked at the end of :code:`prepare_for_execution`. If the
  conditions are not met then an errors are raised with the associated messages during the
  :code:`prepare_for_execution` sequence. These should raise informative errors if
  any of the final set of properties don't make sense.
