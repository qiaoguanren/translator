Backbone Cleaning Rules
-----------------------
If a step contains a common solvent then that solvent is used for backbone
cleaning after that step. If the last clean didn't also use that solvent, a
backbone clean using the solvent is also performed before the step. If no
common solvent is used in a step the last encountered common solvent is used.
e.g.
Add( acetone )
CleanBackbone( acetone )
Add( acetic anhydride )
CleanBackbone( acetone )
CleanBackbone( water )
Add( aqueous_oxone_solution )
CleanBackbone( water )
CleanBackbone( ether )
Add( ether )
CleanBackbone( ether )
...

Vessel Cleaning Rules
---------------------
Vessels are cleaned after emptying steps if the step preceding the emptying step
was a dissolve step. This is to make sure that no vessels are cleaned after
emptying steps when they actually still contain solids.
e.g.
...
Evaporate rotavap
Dissolve rotavap
Transfer rotavap -> reactor
CleanVessel rotavap
...
